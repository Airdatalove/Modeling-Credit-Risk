    "\n",

    "Primarily concerned with 2 types of misclassification:\n",
    "* **false positives**: we predict that a loan will be paid off on time, but it actually isn't.This costs us money, since we fund loans that lose us money. \n",

    "We mentioned earlier that there is a significant class imbalance in the loan_status column. There are 6 times as many loans that were paid off on time (1), than loans that weren't paid off on time (0). This causes a major issue when we use accuracy as a metric. This is because due to the class imbalance, a classifier can predict 1 for every row, and still have high accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it's important to always be aware of imbalanced classes in machine learning models, and to adjust your error metric accordingly. In this case, **we don't want to use accuracy, and should instead use metrics that tell us the number of false positives and false negatives**.\n",
